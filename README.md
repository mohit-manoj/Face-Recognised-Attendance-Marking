# Face-Recognised-Attendance-Marking
A GUI-based smart attendance system that automates student attendance recording using real-time facial recognition. Built with OpenCV, Tkinter, and a MySQL database, the system captures face data, trains a recognizer, detects faces live, and logs attendance to a CSV file with timestamps.
